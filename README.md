# XFCGarage
submod for XcomFiles OXCE MOD. Adds a garaje facility

This submod adds a 1x1 facility to hold small ground crafts as cars and similar. 
It needs the Hangars-reworked/Rejected-Features fork of OXCE+, in order to only 
allow cars to be allocated in this type of facility.
That fork adds a "hangar type" id to both facilities and crafts, so they can 
only match if have the same id (vanilla-not-id'ed crafts and facilities have
a default -1 id, to work as intended in original OXCE)
