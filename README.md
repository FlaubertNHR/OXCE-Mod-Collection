# OXCE Mod Collection

This repository implements different MODs for OXCE and Xcom Files MOD. Some are intended to work only with certain forks of original OXCE (see below)

## XFCGarage
Mod for OXCE "Hangars Reworked" fork. Originally intended as a submod for XComFiles MOD, but can be adapted to other MODs and vanilla game.

This submod adds a 1x1 facility to hold small ground crafts as cars and similar. 

The fork adds a "hangar type" id to both facilities and crafts, so they can only match if have the same id (vanilla-not-id'ed crafts and facilities have
a default -1 id, to work as intended in original OXCE).

The mod adds a new garage 1x1 facility, so only cars are allowed to be allocated inside.

## XFCNewFacilities

Mod for OXCE "Hangars Reworked" fork. Originally intended as a submod for XComFiles MOD, but can be adapted to other MODs and vanilla game.

The mod adds some new "hangar types" (2x2 and 3x3) with more crafts allocation slots. It also adds a garage.
Finally it modifies 2x2 Large Storage so it can be built over Storage 1x1 facilities.

## XComFilesRetainCorpses
Submod for XCom Files master mod. It simply deactivates a fixed option that prevents retain enemies corpses when interrogation finishes.

## MissileMOD (WIP)
A WIP mod to adapt some crafts and facilities for "missile/kamikaze" behavior, which is being implemented at another WIP fork.
